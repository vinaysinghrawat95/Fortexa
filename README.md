# Fortexa

> **A secure, scalable, real-time web chat application**

Fortexa is a modern online chat application built with a clean frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Tailwind) and a robust backend (Spring Boot + Hibernate). It supports multi-user real-time conversations, group chats, and strict security measures to keep user data private and safe.

---

## 🔑 Key Highlights

* **Real-time messaging** using WebSocket (STOMP/SockJS compatible) for low-latency chat.
* **Multi-user & Group Chats**: 1:1 and 1\:many conversations, channels/rooms, and private groups.
* **Security-first design**: TLS (HTTPS/WSS), JWT-based auth, strong password hashing, role-based access control, input validation, rate limiting, and audit logging.
* **Scalable architecture**: Stateless backend services, horizontal scaling, Redis for message brokering/ pub-sub or caching, and optional Kafka for high-throughput scenarios.
* **Developer-friendly**: Docker support, CI/CD tips, and detailed setup instructions.

---

## 🚀 Features

* User registration & login (email verification)
* JWT authentication with refresh tokens
* Real-time chat (WebSocket) with typing indicators and read receipts
* Create/join/leave chat rooms
* Message persistence with Hibernate + relational DB (MySQL/Postgres)
* End-to-end encryption (optional upgrade) for private messages
* Moderation tools: mute, kick, ban, admin dashboard
* Secure file/image sharing (signed URLs, virus scanning recommended)
* Offline message queueing and delivery on reconnect
* Message search & history with pagination
* Presence (online/offline) and last-seen timestamps

---

## 🧱 Tech Stack

**Frontend**

* HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (vanilla)
* Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling

**Backend**

* Java, Spring Boot (REST + WebSocket)
* Hibernate / JPA for ORM
* Spring Security for authentication & authorization
* JWT (access + refresh tokens)

**Data & Messaging**

* Relational DB: MySQL or PostgreSQL
* Redis for session store, caching, presence, and Pub/Sub
* Optional: Kafka for large-scale message streaming

**Infra / DevOps**

* Docker & Docker Compose
* CI/CD: GitHub Actions / GitLab CI
* HTTPS with Let's Encrypt or managed certificates
* Optional: Kubernetes for orchestration

## 🔒 Security & Best Practices (must-read)

Fortexa is designed with defense-in-depth. Follow these recommended practices when developing or deploying:

**Transport encryption**

* Always serve over HTTPS and WSS. Terminate TLS at the edge (reverse proxy/load balancer) or let the app use certs directly.

**Authentication & sessions**

* Use short-lived JWT access tokens + secure, HTTP-only refresh tokens.
* Store refresh tokens securely (DB or Redis) and rotate on use.
* Use `SameSite=Strict` for cookies where applicable.

**Password storage**

* Use a slow adaptive hashing algorithm (bcrypt, Argon2). Never store plaintext.

**Input validation & output encoding**

* Validate and sanitize all input on server-side.
* Use parameterized queries (Hibernate/JPA does this for you when used correctly).
* Escape or safely render user-generated content to prevent XSS.

**WebSocket security**

* Authenticate WebSocket upgrades (use JWT in the handshake).
* Enforce per-connection rate limits and message size caps.
* Use origin checking and CSRF protections where applicable.

**Authorization**

* Principle of least privilege. Role-based access for admin/moderator features.

**Encryption at rest & in transit**

* Encrypt sensitive fields (PII) in the database when required.
* Consider field-level E2E encryption for highly sensitive messages.

**Operational security**

* Enable request logging and immutable audit logs.
* Rate-limit endpoints to mitigate brute-force and DoS.
* Periodic dependency & vulnerability scanning (Dependabot, Snyk).
* Regular backups and tested restore procedures.

## 🧩 Architecture (suggested)

```
Client (Browser)
   └─ HTTPS / WSS
      └─ Load Balancer / Reverse Proxy (TLS)
         ├─ Spring Boot App instances (stateless)
         │   ├─ REST endpoints (auth, profile, room management)
         │   └─ WebSocket endpoints (real-time messaging)
         ├─ Redis (cache, presence, pub/sub)
         └─ Relational DB (MySQL/Postgres) via Hibernate
```

Notes:

* Use sticky sessions only if you cannot share WebSocket state through Redis or external broker; prefer stateless app + Redis.
* For horizontal scaling of chat, consider a message broker (Redis Streams / Kafka) to fan-out messages.

## ⚙️ Installation (developer setup)

> Example commands assume a Unix-like environment and Docker is installed.

1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/fortexa.git
cd fortexa
```

2. Create `.env` files for backend and for Docker Compose (see `.env.example`)

3. Start services (DB + Redis) with Docker Compose (optional)

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

4. Build and run backend

```bash
./mvnw clean package
java -jar backend/target/fortexa-backend.jar
```

5. Open frontend

* For static HTML/CSS: open `frontend/index.html`
* For SPA dev environment: run dev server (if using Vite/React)

---

## 🔧 Environment variables (example)

```
# Server
SERVER_PORT=8080
SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=dev

# Database
DB_URL=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/fortexa
DB_USERNAME=fortexa
DB_PASSWORD=securepassword

# Redis
REDIS_HOST=localhost
REDIS_PORT=6379

# JWT
JWT_SECRET=verylongrandomsecret
JWT_EXPIRATION_MS=900000        # 15 min
JWT_REFRESH_EXPIRATION_MS=2592000000 # 30 days

# File storage
FILE_STORAGE_PROVIDER=local|s3
S3_BUCKET=fortexa-uploads
```

> ⚠️ Keep secrets out of source control. Use secret managers in production.

---

## 🧪 Running tests

* Unit tests: `./mvnw test`
* Integration tests: configure test DB and run `./mvnw verify`
* Linting & formatting: configure your frontend tooling (Prettier, ESLint)

---

## 📦 Docker & Deployment

* Provide a `Dockerfile` for the backend and a `docker-compose.yml` for local dev.
* Example: run backend container with environment variables and link to DB & Redis.
* For production: use orchestration (Kubernetes), configure health checks, readiness & liveness probes, and secrets management.

---

## 🔁 CI/CD Recommendations

* Run tests, static analysis, and security scans on PRs.
* Build artifacts in CI and push images to a registry (GHCR / Docker Hub).
* Use automated deployments with staged environments (staging -> production).
* Rotate secrets automatically and use short-lived credentials where possible.

---

## 📡 Monitoring & Observability

* Application metrics (Prometheus) and alerting (Alertmanager)
* Centralized logs (EFK/ELK stack)
* Tracing (Jaeger / Zipkin)
* Health dashboards and uptime monitoring

## 🧭 API & WebSocket contract (summary)

**Auth**

* `POST /api/auth/register` — register user
* `POST /api/auth/login` — returns JWT access + refresh
* `POST /api/auth/refresh` — rotate refresh token

**Users & Rooms**

* `GET /api/users/{id}` — profile
* `POST /api/rooms` — create room
* `GET /api/rooms/{id}/messages` — paginated message history

**WebSocket**

* Connect to `wss://<host>/ws` with Authorization header `Bearer <token>` during handshake
* Topics: `/topic/rooms/{roomId}` for broadcast, `/user/queue/messages` for direct messages
* Send shape: `{ "type": "MESSAGE", "roomId": "<id>", "content": "Hello" }`

Include robust message validation and schema versioning for forward/backward compatibility.
